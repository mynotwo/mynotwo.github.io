Hi there! I’m a 4th year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), advised by Prof. Chun Jason Xue at CityU and Prof. Tei-Wei Kuo at National Taiwan University. My research interests lie in building next-generation data compression algorithms and systems (e.g., combined with neural networks), neural-network acceleration, and edge computing. 

# 🔥 News
- *2024.05*: &nbsp; I successfully completed my thesis defense 🎉. 
- *2023.10*: &nbsp; We won the second prize at the ICCAD TinyML Contest. 
- *2023.05*: &nbsp; I was invited as female student representitive to give a talk at CityU PhD forum. 
- *2023.02*: &nbsp; Our paper “Faster and stronger Lossless Compression with Optimized Autoregressive framework” was accepted in DAC 2023.
