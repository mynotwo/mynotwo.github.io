Hi there! I‚Äôm a 4th year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Chun Jason Xue at CityU and Prof. Tei-Wei Kuo at National Taiwan University. I obtained MS degree in Information and Communication Engineering in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunication and BE in Electronic and Information Engineering in South China University of Technology.

My research interests lie in building next-generation data compression algorithms and systems (e.g., combined with neural networks), neural-network acceleration, and edge computing. I currently serve as a reviewer of Nips, CVPR, TKDE, MM and ERC of ATC.
