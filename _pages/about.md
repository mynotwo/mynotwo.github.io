Hi there! I‚Äôm a 4th year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), advised by Prof. Chun Jason Xue at CityU and Prof. Tei-Wei Kuo at National Taiwan University. My research interests lie in building next-generation data compression algorithms and systems (e.g., combined with neural networks), neural-network acceleration, and edge computing.
